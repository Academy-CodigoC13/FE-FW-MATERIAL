# Vue.js Quick Start Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a new Vue.js project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v8.9 or above)
- npm package manager (v5.5.1 or above)

You can verify that you are running the correct version of Node.js and npm by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Step 1: Install the Vue CLI

The Vue CLI is a command-line interface for Vue.js. You can install it globally on your machine with the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

## Step 2: Create a new Vue project

Navigate to the directory where you want to create your new project, and run the following command:

```bash
vue create my-vue-app
```

Replace "my-vue-app" with the name you want for your project.

## Step 3: Serve the application

Navigate into your new project's directory:

```bash
cd my-vue-app
```

Then serve the application using the following command:

```bash
npm run serve
```

## Step 4: Open your app in a browser

You can now navigate to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser to see your new Vue app in action.

## Step 5: Edit your first Vue component

Vue components are the fundamental building blocks of Vue applications. You can find your first component in `src/App.vue`.
