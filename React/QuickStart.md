# ReactJS Quick Start Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a new ReactJS project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v10.16 or later)
- npm package manager (v5.6 or later)

You can verify that you are running the correct version of Node.js and npm by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Step 1: Create a new React project
You can create a new ReactJS project using the `create-react-app` command. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your new project, and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-react-app
```
Replace "my-react-app" with the name you want for your project.

## Step 2: Start the development server
Navigate into your new project's directory:

```bash
cd my-react-app
```

Then start the development server using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

## Step 3: Open your app in a browser

You can now navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to see your new React app in action.

## Step 4: Edit your first React component

React components are the fundamental building blocks of React applications. You can find your first component in `src/App.js`.
